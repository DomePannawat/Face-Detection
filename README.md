Face Detection Application

Overview

The Face Detection Application is a Python-based program that utilizes OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries for real-time face detection. This application provides a user-friendly interface through Tkinter, enabling users to start and stop the camera feed and detect faces efficiently. Detected frames can also be saved in a designated directory for further analysis.

Features

- Real-time Face Detection : Employs Mediapipe's advanced face detection algorithms to accurately identify faces from a live camera feed.
- Intuitive User Interface : Built with Tkinter, ensuring ease of use for all users.
- Automatic Frame Saving : Captures and stores images of detected faces in a specified folder.
- Responsive Design : Designed to function smoothly on various screen sizes.

Requirements

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with standard Python installations)

Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install mediapipe

After that you can run the code.
